# Metaverse Land: Securing Your Virtual Property with FHE

Metaverse Land introduces a groundbreaking way to own private land in a metaverse, powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. By merging the vast possibilities of virtual land ownership with the crucial need for privacy and security, this project ensures that landowners can enjoy their metaverse experiences without compromising their real-world identities.

## Problem Statement

As the metaverse continues to grow and attract users, privacy concerns have emerged as a significant issue. Landowners face the risk of their identities being exposed, leading to potential breaches of security and personal data. Individuals require a secure method to manage their virtual properties without revealing sensitive information that could compromise their offline safety and personal lives.

## The FHE Solution

Zama’s Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) addresses these privacy concerns by ensuring that land ownership details remain encrypted and secure. This project utilizes **Zama's open-source libraries**, including the **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, to implement a sophisticated privacy layer. With FHE, even while interacting with other users or managing properties, the identity of landowners is maintained in confidentiality, allowing them to engage without fear of recognition or judgment. 

Through FHE, we can effectively hide the identity of landowners while still enabling them to enjoy all the functionalities of the metaverse environment, hence establishing a necessary privacy layer for the evolution of virtual real estate.

## Key Features

- **FHE-Encryped Identity:** Landowner identities are securely encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Anonymous Neighbors:** Neighbors cannot easily identify each other, fostering a safer virtual community.
- **Enhanced Privacy:** Users can enjoy the metaverse while retaining control over their offline safety.
- **Digital Identity Integration:** Incorporates Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to provide a unique, secure representation of landowners.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development.
- **Node.js**: Backend server and dependencies.
- **Hardhat**: Testing and deployment framework.
- **Concrete / TFHE-rs**: Zama's FHE libraries for confidential computations.
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: Interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Installation Guide

To set up the Metaverse Land project, follow these steps. Make sure you have **Node.js** and **Hardhat** or **Foundry** installed on your system.

1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the command below to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. This command also fetches the required Zama FHE libraries to enable confidential computations.

**Please refrain from using `git clone` or any URLs to download this project.**

## Build & Run Guide

Once your environment is set up, you can compile, test, and run your project by following these commands:

1. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. Run the tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. Deploy the contracts to your chosen network:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

4. Interact with your deployed contracts:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

## Code Example

Here’s a small code snippet illustrating how land ownership is secured using FHE in the smart contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MetaverseLand {
    struct Land {
        bytes32 encryptedOwnerID; // Encrypted user's DID
        uint256 size; // Size of the land
    }

    mapping(uint256 => Land) public lands;

    function registerLand(uint256 landId, bytes32 encryptedID, uint256 size) public {
        lands[landId] = Land(encryptedID, size);
    }

    function getLandOwner(uint256 landId) public view returns (bytes32) {
        return lands[landId].encryptedOwnerID; // Returns the encrypted ID
    }
}
```

This code demonstrates how the land ownership is registered with an encrypted identity, preserving the privacy of the landowner.
